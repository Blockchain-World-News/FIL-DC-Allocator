    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Mongo2Stor (MongoStorage) is working as Storage Service Provider, DataPrep and consulting services in the Filecoin echo system. Based in Southern California, USA, Mongo2Stor is also a FIL Green GOLD Certified and worked with many providers through ESPA. The founders have vast experience in networks and systems, and have gone through multiple sessions, presentation at ESPA and featured in the Zero to One Service Provider Twitter session by the Protocol Labs with Porter and Bob.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved output from various research activities and includes accompanying software and documentation needed to understand and analyze the data.\n\nThe portal adheres to established global standards in data preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they are issued with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects.\n\nMore details are below:\n\nhttps://opendata.cern.ch/docs/about\nhttps://opendata.cern.ch/record/415/files/CMS-Data-Policy-1.3.pdf",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Singularity",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Simulated dataset ZZZ_TuneCP5_13TeV-amcatnlo-pythia8 in NANOAODSIM format for 2016 collision data \nhttps://opendata.cern.ch/record/75601",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "North America, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "SP Miner IDs\tContact name\tSP Business Email\tSP Organization Name\tRegion\tUsing VPN?\tSlack handle\nf01697248\tHenry Moon\tcontact@simpleipfs.com\tSimple IPFS Inc.\tSouth Korea\tNo\thyunmoon\nf01904546\tHenry Moon\tcontact@simpleipfs.com\tSimple IPFS Inc.\tSouth Korea\tNo\thyunmoon\nf02846602\tAzher Mughal\tazheramin@gmail.com\tMongo2Stor\t        CA, US\tNo\t        mongo\nf03199233\tHenry Moon\tcontact@simpleipfs.com\tSimple IPFS Inc.\tCA, US\tNo\t        hyunmoon\nf0763337        James           support@piknik.com      PiKNiK                  CA, US  No              James",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"

    "Brief history of your project and organization": "At Modrons' Law, we believe that rules and laws are the fundamental principles governing the world, and that the mechanical paradigm is the key to the advancement of civilization. Humanity is progressively deepening its understanding of these principles, categorizing them into various scientific disciplines. As civilization evolves by emulating these principles—whether socially or mathematically—our comprehension of the world's rules is both validated and enhanced. Our mission is to drive this emulation forward in the field of computer science, fostering innovation and progress.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

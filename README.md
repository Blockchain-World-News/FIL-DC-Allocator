##Client Dilligence
#1.Client Verification & Initial Trust Establishment
We will have to go through strict KYC verification. And have an in-depth understanding of the project background research (public website, GitHub, white paper)

#2. Sybil Attack Mitigation
 1. I would use a third party KYC service to confirm the identity of the customer and the organization he represents. I would consider using the ""toggle"" third party tool.
 2. The client will need to provide a GitHub account, a slack account.
 3. The third party tool ""toggle"" verification may involve face verification and ID verification.
 4. We hereby declare that the private information of the customer is only used to verify whether the customer is a real person or not, and will not use the information for other purposes.
3.Automated Pathway Controls
There are new standards and strict rules for reviewing data as well as KYB/KYC.
In checking the geographic location of SPs and the content they store, the rules will be strictly enforced.
In response to the current slow response from the Fil+ community and the inability to fulfill customers' needs in the first time. We will have time to deal with this on a daily basis.
Communication efficiency, customer and community participation will be greatly improved.
4. Enterprise or Paying Client Ownership Verification
I will use a third party KYB tool to verify business clients

Some of the verification information includes:

Organization name, nationality, country of incorporation, time of incorporation, names of executives and relevant websites
Business license
Business authorization letter (CEO signature + stamp)
Sample data submission (20% of total DataCap applications)
Business perception of Filecoin
Social media (official website, WeChat, LinkedIn, GitHub)
5. Auditable Diligence Evidence for Governance
we need to confirm their identification.

For individual customers, the verification of their identity will be verified through:

Identification number
Name
Data of birth
Copy of Passport
Address
Social media account (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter)
Local Offices Contact Details
Social reputation (Prize, Achievement)
For corporate clients, the verification of their identity will be verified through:

Company Registration Certificate/Operating Licence
Address
Website
Social media account (Facebook/Linkedin/Twitter)
Record of law suits and legal reputation
Company equity structure and key stakeholders
Scanned copy of letter from company with stamps and signature of director/stakeholder from the company
Stakeholder due diligence process for company shares/equity over 20%. (Stakeholder due diligence process will be similar to the above process, until the final beneficiary/the-actual-stakeholder is found.)
